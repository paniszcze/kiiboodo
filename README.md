## About

キーボード (kībōdo) is a single page application built with React. It was developped for Japanese language learners to make the skill of typing Japanese caracters a bit more fun to master.

The task at hand is to type Japanese words that appear on the screen and move downward before they reach the bottom line of the canvas frame. Each correctly typed word earns you some points, and each missed one – costs you a life! But don't worry, you have 4 of them. Just make sure to endure as long as possible and gain a ton of points!

The word list includes entries written in hiragana and katakana only. There are no kanji characters in order to make the practice more about typing and memorizing keyboard layout rather than recognizing kanji.

Good luck!

***Note***: *Make sure to switch to Japanese input mode in your OS before starting to type, as there is no conversion of latin alphabet letters nor any key mappings.*
